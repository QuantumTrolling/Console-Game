# Console-Game

Introduction:

Project, which you can see here, it’s a short game in console. I made this game on subject “fundamental of programming”. This game was written on language C++ in “Microsoft Visual Studio 2019”.

Main idea of the project is to make a game, which based on method “_getch” and moving the cursor to a point given by coordinates. I needed to create a character that could be controlled by using keyboard keys and add more some interactive to it. In the end a got this game.

I completed this project on my own as first-year student in 2021.
